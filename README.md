# Sorting Algorithm Comparison


This is the repository for the paper on sorting algorithms. 

The code is writen in python with some of the function modified to work on negative numbers. The file `sort.py` contains the code, it uses a custom library to allow me to output in a lot more human-readable format, you can find the library here https://github.com/python-humanize/humanize.

*After coming back I observed that the code is broken when using the `humanize` library, thus I will also provide `sortNoLibrary.py` in case you might face the same error*

The file `dataset.txt` contains all the arrays used in my tests.

Inside the `Results` folder you can see the results for the tests I've done.


I want to mention that I did not write the code for the different sorting algorithms and took them from an external source, which is mentioned above each algorithm.
