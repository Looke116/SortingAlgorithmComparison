# Sorting Algorithm Comparison


This is the repository for the paper on sorting algorithms. 

The code is not kinda ugly, writen in python with some of the function modified to work on negative numbers. The file `sort.py` contains the code, it uses a custom library to allow me to output in a lot more human-readable format, you can find the library here https://github.com/python-humanize/humanize.

The file `dataset.txt` contains all the arrays used in my tests

Inside the `Results` folder you can see the results for the tests I've done
